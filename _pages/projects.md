# **P4:** Whole Slide Image (WSI) Cadaver Tissue Patch Preparation and Classification
## Summary
In this project, we introduce a challenging dataset, which contains 15 organ classes for deep learning model development and validation. Our publicly available dataset addresses a crucial gap in digital pathology by providing a large, diverse, and annotated collection of whole slide histopathology images, following FAIR principles. It serves as a benchmark for medical imaging analysis tasks like disease classification, and cancer and pneumonia cell segmentation, enabling improved diagnostics and treatment strategies. With its diverse organ classes and a vast number of patches, it is an ideal resource for transfer learning, accelerating research progress. Crucially, by introducing substantial publicly available data into this field, the dataset overcomes a fundamental challenge, paving the way for more robust deep-learning models in digital pathology. Overall approach of our work is provided in the following Figure:
