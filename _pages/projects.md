## Research Projects
- **P5:** Upper Extremity Joint Angle Analysis Using the Combination of EMG and IMUs
  - Assisted in mentoring and collecting data from 13 subjects using the Vicon Motion Capture System, Delsys EMG, and IMUs, followed by data processing in OpenSim software.
  - Developed a novel algorithm for estimating elbow and arm kinematics by integrating IMU and EMG sensor data.

- **P4:** Prediction and Reconstruction of 3D Human Pose Using IMUs and Wearable Cameras
  - Collected data from 20 subjects using Vicon Motion Capture, Delsys IMUs, and two shank-mounted egocentric GoPro cameras, with subsequent processing in OpenSim.
  - Introduced an innovative approach that integrates whole-body IMUs with wearable camera features to accurately reconstruct current 3D poses and predict future movements.

- **P3:** Sparse IMU Sensor-Based Joint Angles, Joint Moments, and GRFs Estimation
  - Proposed novel methods for estimating joint angles, joint moments, and ground reaction forces (GRFs) using a sparse configuration of inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors.
  - Leveraged a new technique called sensor distillation and multi-modal fusion to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the estimations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning models while remaining computationally lightweight.

- **P2:** Smartphone-Video Based Human Kinetics Estimation
  - Developed an innovative method for estimating knee adduction moment (KAM), knee flexion moment (KFM), and 3D ground reaction forces (GRFs) using only smartphone video data.
  - The method employs a two-step knowledge distillation and multi-modal fusion technique to achieve high accuracy in kinetics estimation.

- **P1:** Whole Slide Image (WSI) Cadaver Tissue Patch Preparation and Classification
  - Curated and prepared 1,700 WSIs from various organs for further analysis.
  - Created patches from these WSIs to establish a benchmark dataset for classifying 15 different organs.
