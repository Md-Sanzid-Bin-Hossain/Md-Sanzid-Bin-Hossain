My research primarily focuses on advanced AI-based approaches, utilizing wearables for more practical, cost-effective, and accurate human gait analysis, while also integrating deep learning for clinical decision-making in digital pathology and radiology. This interdisciplinary work contributes to the development of more personalized, automated, and timely healthcare solutions. I have published several high-impact journals, conferences, and conference abstracts in these fields.
