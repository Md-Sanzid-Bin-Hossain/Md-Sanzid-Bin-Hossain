I am currently a postdoctoral scholar in the department of clinical science, college of medicine at University of Central Florida under Dr. Dexter Hadley. I completed my PhD in the summer of 2024 in Computer Engineering at the ECE department of the University of Central Florida under the supervision of Dr. Hwan Choi and Dr. Zhishan Guo in [Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Device Lab (REAL)](https://mae.ucf.edu/REAL/) and [Real-Time and Intelligent Systems (RTIS) Lab](https://zguo32.wordpress.ncsu.edu/sample-page/). I received my B.Sc degree from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 2017. My research interest includes AI-based wearables for gait monitoring, digital pathology, and digital radiology.
